# Changelog

## 2.1.224

- Added self-hosted environments: `claude self-hosted-runner` turns your own machines or containers into a place Claude Code web, mobile, and desktop sessions can run, on Team and Enterprise plans
- Added `archive` plugin source: install plugins from a zip over HTTPS without git or npm, with optional SHA-256 pinning
- Added a cancel-and-confirm step when removing an unavailable paste changes a command's text
- Added `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_REGION_PREFIX` env var for Bedrock to prefer a specific cross-region inference profile over the `AWS_REGION`-derived one
- Added `crossSessionInbound` and `dialogExpiry` settings: cross-session messages sent to a session running with bypassed permissions are held for your approval, and messages to other sessions auto-deliver
- Added sandbox credential-masking options: `extract` and `onExtractNoMatch` for structured env values, `decode: "jwt"` with `maskClaims` for JWT-aware masking, and `awsPairs`/`sigv4` for AWS SigV4 re-signing; these need `network.tlsTerminate` and are honored only from user, managed, or `--settings` settings
- Added cross-session `SendMessage`: Claude Code sessions can now message each other, on any of your machines, with `ListAgents` to discover them (macOS and Linux)
- Fixed long (>200 char) project paths resolving to another project's session directory under a shared sanitized prefix; session list, rename, fork, delete and `/resume` no longer cross projects
- Fixed `SendMessage` reporting "Message sent" when the write to a teammate's inbox had actually failed; failed deliveries are now reported as errors
- Fixed sandbox filesystem deny entries written with a trailing slash (e.g. `denyRead: "~/.aws/"`) being silently bypassable on Linux and macOS
- Fixed sandbox violation details never appearing in Bash tool results; Claude now sees which file or network access was denied and why
- Fixed MCP tools that connect mid-turn being deferred for tool search without their names announced to the model
- Fixed plugin install records being silently corrupted when the same plugin is installed in multiple projects
- Fixed recalled or restored paste content occasionally attaching wrong data or silently losing text when the paste had aged out or placeholder numbers collided
- Fixed copy-on-select on Wayland sometimes not reaching the clipboard; the two selection writes no longer race
- Fixed the feedback survey's transcript share silently failing on long sessions; a failed share now shows an error instead of a success message
- Fixed Remote Control auto-start intermittently failing with "Remote credentials fetch failed" on a cold start with a stale login token
- Fixed Remote Control and SDK clients showing a blank "(no content)" message after `/clear` and other output-less commands
- Fixed a Remote Control session recreated after its server session expired uploading prior local conversation history into the new session
- Improved fullscreen mode to keep the full pre-compaction history in scrollback across repeated compactions, instead of only the most recent interval
- Improved Remote Control: attached web and mobile clients now see compaction progress and the post-compaction boundary instead of a silent pause; `/clear` resets now propagate to attached clients
- Improved Remote Control: connection failures now show a persistent failure indicator with details and a reconnect shortcut, instead of only an 8-second toast
- Removed the 200-subagent-per-session spawn cap; long-running sessions no longer refuse new agents (concurrency and depth limits still apply)
- Changed managed settings: the approval prompt no longer re-appears after re-login or org switching when the organization's settings are unchanged
- Changed the feedback-survey transcript share: with your consent it now also uploads the last request's model settings — the system prompt (which includes your `CLAUDE.md` instructions), tool definitions, and model parameters. Secrets are redacted as before, and these fields are dropped first if the share is too large
- Changed the Bash tool description to always note that command output is displayed to the model, not reliably to the user
- Changed recalled paste placeholder numbers to renumber when accepted into the input
- Changed Remote Control to archive the stale server session instead of leaving a dead one listed when a fresh session is minted after compaction or `/resume`
- [VSCode] Fixed the extension showing Remote Control as connected after the connection failed
- Fixed a session resume silently reconnecting Remote Control after the user turned it off (`--resume`, SDK hosts, and the VS Code extension)
- [VSCode] Fixed sessions not honoring `remoteControlAtStartup` when explicitly enabled

## 2.1.223

- Added owner wildcard entries (`"owner/*"`) to the `strictKnownMarketplaces` and `blockedMarketplaces` managed settings for allowing or blocking all marketplace repos under a GitHub org
- Added a warning when workflow agents, forked skills, slash commands, or resumed background agents' requested subagent model is restricted and the parent model runs instead
- Added a `/teleport` hint in cloud sessions showing how to continue locally with `claude --teleport <session id>`
- Fixed a Bash permission bypass where a crafted command could hide parts of itself from permission checks
- Fixed permission prompts so commands padded with tabs or invisible Unicode can no longer hide part of the command from the approval dialog
- Fixed workflow scripts being able to use dynamic `import()` to run code outside the workflow sandbox
- Fixed a permission gap where an agent definition's `bypassPermissions` mode ignored the org bypass-permissions disable policy
- Fixed resuming a session after a mid-session `/cd` coming back empty
- Fixed gateway model discovery hiding Claude models registered under provider-prefixed IDs such as `vertex_ai/claude-*` or `bedrock/anthropic.claude-*`
- Fixed `modelOverrides` keys that aren't Anthropic model IDs being treated as the session's canonical model ID; unknown keys are now ignored as documented
- Fixed managed settings: server-delivered settings no longer disable the env block of a machine-local `managed-settings.json` or MDM profile; admin env now merges per key
- Fixed sandboxed commands failing to start on Linux when `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite` covers the working directory
- Fixed forked background agents getting stuck "already resuming" for the rest of the session when rebuilding the fork's parent prompt failed during resume
- Fixed a resumed session failing every turn, or leaving the interactive app on an unresponsive error screen, when its history held a malformed diagnostics attachment
- Fixed a rare hang when parsing unusual `git push` output
- Changed `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` to hold every Claude model with a native 1M window to 200K via auto-compaction, not just a fixed list; a startup warning now appears when auto-compaction isn't holding the session to 200K
- Changed auto-compact to keep sessions on unrecognized model IDs within the assumed context window instead of letting them grow past it; set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT=1` to restore the previous behavior
- Changed `/review` to be an alias of `/code-review`, which reviews the current diff or a PR (`/code-review <level> <pr#>`); use `/code-review ultra` for a deep cloud review
- Changed `/code-review` with no effort level to reuse the level you typed last; type a level like `/code-review high` to change it

## 2.1.222

- Fixed worktree-isolated sessions and their subagents being able to run destructive git commands against the main checkout; isolation now applies to file edits and Bash in every session type
- Fixed PreToolUse auto-allow hooks bypassing tool restrictions in background agent tasks (summaries, compaction, renames)
- Fixed `/usage-credits` on Team and Enterprise showing "you've already sent a usage credit request" for members whose earlier request was dismissed, blocking them from sending a new one
- Fixed the startup connectivity check hanging and then failing behind an HTTPS proxy; it now uses the same proxy-aware transport as API requests and times out with a clear message
- Fixed "Connection closed mid-response" errors being reported on responses that had actually completed
- Fixed `/usage` overattributing usage to MCP servers: a server's share now reflects only the requests that actually consumed its tool results, instead of every turn after any call to it
- Fixed sessions not linking to pull requests created after the branch was pushed, including through the GitHub REST API
- Fixed org-restricted `model: opus`-style subagent and teammate family aliases dropping to the parent model instead of stepping down to the newest org-allowed model in the family
- Fixed stream idle timeout firing on custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateways despite server keep-alive pings arriving on the wire
- Fixed claude.ai connectors being falsely marked as needing authorization when the session token is invalid — they now show a `/login` hint instead
- Fixed tool errors not being displayed for tools no longer available locally, for example after an MCP server is removed
- Fixed `SendMessage` rejecting a long summary — it now truncates instead, so sends no longer fail on a character limit
- Fixed the spinner's effort label in a subagent's transcript view showing the session's effort level instead of the subagent's own `effort:` setting
- Fixed rare crashes when a file watcher hit a filesystem error or during file-watcher teardown
- Fixed screen readers re-reading the whole input line on every backspace in `--ax-screen-reader` mode — end-of-line deletions now echo just the deleted characters
- Fixed host model-selection keys not taking precedence over a stale on-disk `managed-settings.json` when `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST` is set
- Improved auto mode safety: messages sent to other agent sessions via `SendMessage` are now evaluated by the permission classifier before dispatch
- Improved the refusal when Claude tries to invoke a skill with `disable-model-invocation`: Claude is now told to ask you to run the skill instead of replicating its workflow
- Improved the `/diff` view, the Remote Control workspace diff, and file-edit diffs in Claude Code on the web sessions to use raw git blob content, ignoring workspace-configured diff drivers and textconv
- Changed Remote Control auto-start so repo-local settings (`.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) can no longer turn it on (they can still turn it off); enable it at user scope via `/config`
- Removed ultraplan feature

## 2.1.221

- [VSCode] Added Focus view: a chat-menu toggle that hides tool activity behind an expandable per-turn summary with a live running-tool indicator, toggled with `Ctrl+Alt+F` or the "Claude Code: Toggle Focus view" command
- Added `mode: "mask"` for sandbox credential files on Linux and WSL — sandboxed commands read a sentinel copy (the whole file, or just the spans captured by an `extract` regex) while the sandbox proxy substitutes the real value on egress; on macOS file masking falls back to `deny`
- Added warnings to `claude plugin validate` when a marketplace or plugin name would be rejected by Claude Desktop's managed marketplace sync
- Added a `prompt-audit` subcommand to the `claude-api` skill for auditing prompts and tool descriptions for patterns written for older models
- Fixed a Bash tool permission-check bypass where zsh could execute hidden commands in `[[ ]]` regex conditionals; affected commands now prompt for permission
- Fixed PowerShell permission checks mishandling paths containing quote characters on Windows; such paths now prompt for approval
- Fixed the thinking toggle having no effect for the rest of a session that started with thinking off; disabling an MCP server mid-connect no longer silently reverts
- Fixed MCP servers from `--mcp-config` not being connected before the f
