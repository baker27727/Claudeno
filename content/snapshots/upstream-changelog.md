# Changelog

## 2.1.211

- Added `--forward-subagent-text` flag and `CLAUDE_CODE_FORWARD_SUBAGENT_TEXT` environment variable to include subagent text and thinking in stream-json output
- Fixed permission previews relayed to chat channels not neutralizing bidirectional-override, zero-width, and look-alike quote characters, so tool inputs cannot visually alter the approval message
- Fixed auto mode overriding a PreToolUse hook's `ask` decision for unsandboxed Bash — a hook `ask` now floors the decision at a prompt
- Fixed parallel Claude Code sessions all logging out simultaneously after wake-from-sleep when many sessions share one credential store
- Fixed plugin MCP servers not reconnecting after an idle web session woke, leaving MCP calls failing until the next message
- Fixed Claude Code on Vertex and Bedrock attempting the default Opus model at startup and printing a spurious fallback notice when a model is explicitly configured
- Fixed subagents spawned with an explicit model override reverting to the parent's model when resumed or sent a follow-up message
- Fixed nested `.claude/rules/*.md` files loading even when setting sources exclude project settings
- Fixed file upload validation: filenames ending in a DOS device suffix (`.prn`) or trailing dot are now accepted, and files with multiple hard links are refused
- Fixed file uploads to Claude in Chrome from remote and CLI sessions
- Fixed edits that leave the input as "?" being silently swallowed and toggling the shortcuts panel
- Fixed a startup hang when the Claude in Chrome extension is enabled but Chrome is not running
- Fixed a 300ms delay revealing async content (Settings tabs, Stats, diff views, and other loading states)
- Fixed reopening a just-stopped background session from the agents view starting a blank conversation under the same session id
- Fixed `/loop` hiding the session from `/resume` after a single use
- Fixed screen reader users losing the audible terminal bell after `/terminal-setup` or onboarding terminal setup
- Fixed background jobs on LLM gateway auth (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) coming back "Not logged in" after the daemon respawns them
- Fixed `claude agents` jobs becoming permanently undeletable when git no longer recognizes their worktree — the row now shows why the delete was refused instead of silently reappearing
- Fixed `/clear` not resetting the session cost counter — the statusline's cost now starts at $0 after `/clear`
- Fixed Claude in Chrome setup pages failing to open in the browser on Windows
- Fixed headless print-mode sessions on Windows crashing or silently exiting when stdin is unreadable
- Fixed background session titles in the agents view showing the naming model's refusal text when the prompt contains a link
- Fixed background agents killed by the user auto-respawning, and revived agents re-running stale prompts from old sessions
- Fixed routines with no schedule reporting a next run time in the year 1
- Hardened synced skill/plugin directory naming on Windows and kept CCR web fetch/search proxies working after `/clear`
- Improved terminal layout and rendering performance
- Improved background agent result reporting — Claude now reports the status of still-running agents and waits for the real completion instead of fabricating results
- Improved the memory index over-limit warning to measure only loaded content, excluding frontmatter and HTML comments
- Updated integer environment variables (timeouts, token budgets, retry counts) to accept scientific notation and digit-separator spellings like `1e6` and `64_000`
- Updated documentation links to the current docs sites
- Changed "always allow" permission rules to save at the repository root, so approvals granted in a git worktree persist across sessions and worktrees
- Changed `/usage-credits` to ask for confirmation before sending a request to organization admins
- Changed Vim mode `s` and `S` (substitute char/line) to work in NORMAL mode, matching vim behavior
- [VSCode] Updated the Remote Control banner to describe what it does
- Claude in Chrome: hardened file-upload path validation
- Claude in Chrome: `save_to_disk` on screenshot actions now writes the image to disk and returns the path; previously it did nothing
- Fixed a prompt-caching regression on Bedrock, Vertex, Mantle, and Foundry that billed the trailing system context block as fresh input tokens on every request.

## 2.1.210

- Added a live elapsed-time counter to the collapsed tool summary line so long-running tool calls visibly tick instead of looking stuck
- Added a startup warning for `Write(path)`, `NotebookEdit(path)`, and `Glob(path)` permission rules — use `Edit(path)` or `Read(path)` instead
- Fixed `isolation: 'worktree'` subagents being able to run git-mutating commands against the main repo checkout instead of their own isolated worktree
- Fixed the `ultracode` keyword opt-in firing on non-human-originated input such as webhook payloads and relayed PR comments
- Fixed a rendered text fragment leaking into crash telemetry when a UI component returned content outside a styled text element
- Fixed paste markers leaking into external editors opened from Claude Code, which could appear as stray È/É characters around pasted text
- Fixed `claude attach` sometimes failing with "job not found" or "agent is still starting" errors during session transitions — attach now waits for the daemon to settle, and terminal resizes during a slow attach are applied once it completes
- Fixed a session crash when a tool's result renderer returned a numeric bigint value or plain text instead of a UI element
- Fixed a hook callback timeout being misreported to the model as a user rejection, which made unattended sessions stop and wait
- Fixed Claude assuming a `cd` took effect after its command was moved to the background; the tool result now states the working directory is unchanged
- Fixed plugin-provided MCP servers being torn down when MCP servers are re-synced mid-session
- Fixed plan approvals without edits being labeled "(edited by user)" and overwriting the plan file with a stale snapshot
- Fixed `/doctor` skipping its auto-mode-default proposal on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, where auto mode no longer needs an opt-in
- Fixed Grep content mode claiming "No matches found" when paginating past the end of results
- Fixed unmatched `$1`/`$2` positional placeholders in skills and commands being silently stripped; they are now preserved verbatim
- Fixed plugin cache writes leaving temp files behind on failure and failing on locked-file renames on Windows and network filesystems
- Fixed background workers crash-looping when a client resets its connection to the background service
- Fixed `claude agents --effort ultracode` not reaching dispatched sessions; the value was silently dropped
- Fixed pressing ← to open the agents view dropping the task tracker when returning to the session
- Fixed the agents dashboard retaining pasted images from abandoned reply drafts after their session was deleted
- Fixed killed background sessions leaving a permanent `git worktree lock` behind; the periodic sweep now releases locks whose owning process is gone
- Fixed SDK MCP servers registered via an `initialize` control request waiting until the next turn to start connecting
- Fixed returning to the agents view from a session leaving overlapping ghost frames with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`
- Fixed late-appearing `.claude/*` symlinks not being reconciled into the sandbox deny-write list
- Hardened the Agent tool against indirect prompt injection via content a subagent read
- Improved the Bash/PowerShell tool message when a command hits its timeout and is auto-backgrounded, so the model can distinguish a hang from an explicit background request
- Improved auto mode: the permission classifier now defaults to Sonnet 5 for external sessions, validated on the session's first request and pinned for the session
- Improved the bundled dataviz skill's chart color validation with perceptual OKLab color difference and recalibrated color-blindness thresholds
- Memory writes that leave a MEMORY.md index over its read limit now produce an explicit error instead of silent truncation
- Screen reader mode now announces permission mode changes aloud when cycling modes with Shift+Tab
- The agents footer hint now shows how many background agents are waiting on your input, with a brief color emphasis when the count changes
- Agent view: the session you pressed ← from stays visibly marked even after mouse hover or arrow keys move the selection
- Fable temporarily shows as unavailable in the advisor picker while a server-side issue causing Fable advisor failures is fixed

## 2.1.209

- Fixed /model and other dialogs being blocked in `claude agents` background sessions (reverts an overly broad guard)

## 2.1.208

- Added screen reader mode: opt-in plain-text rendering for screen reader users. Run `claude --ax-screen-reader`, set CLAUDE_AX_SCREEN_READER=1, or add "axScreenReader": true to settings.
- Added `vimInsertModeRemaps` setting: map two-key insert-mode sequences like `jj` to Escape in vim mode
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_PROCESS_WRAPPER`: agent view and the background service now honor a corporate launcher by running every Claude Code self-spawn through a required wrapper executable
- Added mouse-click support for multi-select menus and "Other" input rows in fullscreen mode
- Fixed fast mode staying off after switching back to a model that supports it — it now restores automatically when enabled in settings
- Fixed replies typed to a background agent being lost when delivery fails — the text is now saved and delivered when the session restarts
- Fixed background-session attach failing permanently ("Couldn't start the background daemon") after an update replaced the binary a running `claude agents` process was launched from
- Fixed the context window (and auto-compact indicator) briefly resetting to 200k after the CLI auto-updates, causing a false "100% context used" when resuming long-context sessions
- Fixed supervised and background sessions crashing when a server closed an HTTP/2 connection with a GOAWAY while requests were in flight
- Fixed truncated stream-json/JSON output and missing result message when piping large responses from `claude -p`
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` and similar env vars silently using the mantissa of scientific-notation values (`1e6` became `1`)
- Fixed very large markdown tables stalling rendering or using excessive memory; tables over 200 rows show the first 200 with a "… N more rows" notice
- Fixed the Edit tool failing on files modified after reading when the target text still matches uniquely
- Fixed Read reporting empty files as "shorter than offset", Grep silently returning "No files found" for invalid regex patterns, Grep count mode under-reporting totals when paginated, and Glob crashing with an unclear error when the pattern, path, or working directory contained a null byte
- Fixed `apiKeyHelper` script failures being hidden behind a generic 401 after ~10 silent retries; the script's own error is now shown within 3 attempts
- Fixed Bedrock streaming requests failing with a misleading "Truncated event message received" when a gateway transforms the response — the error now names the content-type and points at the proxy
- Fixed `/upgrade` showing a login flow instead of the upgrade URL when the browser fails to open
- Fixed stream-json input killing the session on blank CRLF or whitespace-only lines from Windows-style SDK hosts
- Fixed headless stream-json sessions hanging permanently when a `control_request` carried a non-string `set_model` payload; the CLI now answers with an error response
- Fixed repeated "No completion record was found" notices on session resume — orphaned background tasks now collapse into a single summary
- Fixed Remote Control clients attaching to a terminal-hosted session not seeing background agents and w
